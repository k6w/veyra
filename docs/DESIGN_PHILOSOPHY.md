# Veyra Language Design Philosophy

## Core Principles

### 1. Performance by Default
Veyra is designed with performance as a primary concern, not an afterthought.

**Key Decisions:**
- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for maximum runtime performance
- Zero-cost abstractions where possible
- Direct memory access when needed
- LLVM backend for state-of-the-art optimizations

### 2. Memory Safety Without Garbage Collection
Memory safety should not come at the cost of performance or predictability.

**Approach:**
- Ownership system similar to Rust but simplified
- Borrow checker prevents data races and memory leaks
- Optional regions/arenas for bulk allocation patterns
- Escape hatch for unsafe operations when needed

### 3. Concurrency as a First-Class Citizen
Modern applications are concurrent by nature. Veyra makes this easy and safe.

**Features:**
- Green threads (lightweight, user-space threads)
- Actor model for message-passing concurrency
- Async/await for asynchronous programming
- Channels for safe data sharing
- No shared mutable state by default

### 4. Simplicity and Clarity
Code should be easy to read, write, and understand.

**Design Choices:**
- Minimal syntax with strong conventions
- One obvious way to do common tasks
- Strong type inference reduces boilerplate
- Consistent naming and patterns throughout

### 5. Tooling-First Development
Great languages come with great tools built-in.

**Included Tools:**
- Package manager (`vey get`)
- Code formatter (`vey fmt`)
- Linter (`vey lint`)
- REPL (`vey repl`)
- Debugger (`vey dbg`)
- Documentation generator

## Design Inspirations

### From Rust
- Ownership and borrowing for memory safety
- Pattern matching
- Trait system (adapted as interfaces)
- Cargo-like package management

### From Go
- Simplicity and clarity
- Fast compilation
- Built-in concurrency primitives
- Single binary distribution

### From Swift
- Clean, readable syntax
- Optional types for null safety
- Protocol-oriented programming

### From Erlang/Elixir
- Actor model for fault tolerance
- "Let it crash" philosophy
- Supervisors for process management

## Syntax Philosophy

### Readability First
```veyra
# Clear and obvious
fn calculate_total(items: [Item]) -> Money
    total = Money.zero()
    for item in items
        total += item.price
    return total
```

### Minimal Boilerplate
```veyra
# Type inference reduces noise
items = [Item("apple", 1.50), Item("banana", 0.75)]
total = calculate_total(items)
print("Total: {total}")
```

### Consistent Patterns
```veyra
# Error handling
result = dangerous_operation()?
match result
    Ok(value) -> print("Success: {value}")
    Err(error) -> print("Error: {error}")
```

## Trade-offs and Decisions

### Compilation Speed vs Runtime Performance
**Decision:** Prioritize runtime performance
**Rationale:** Developers compile less frequently than users run programs

### Memory Safety vs Manual Control  
**Decision:** Safe by default, unsafe when explicitly requested
**Rationale:** Most code benefits from safety; systems code needs control

### Simplicity vs Expressiveness
**Decision:** Favor simplicity, add expressiveness carefully
**Rationale:** Maintenance is more important than initial development speed

### Backward Compatibility vs Evolution
**Decision:** Break compatibility for meaningful improvements (pre-1.0)
**Rationale:** Better to get the design right than maintain bad decisions

## Non-Goals

### What Veyra is NOT trying to be:

1. **A replacement for every language** - Focused on specific use cases
2. **Beginner-friendly** - Assumes programming experience
3. **Dynamic** - Static typing provides better tooling and performance  
4. **Object-oriented** - Composition over inheritance
5. **Minimalist** - Includes batteries, not just core language

## Success Criteria

Veyra will be successful if:
1. **Performance**: Matches C/C++ in benchmarks
2. **Safety**: Memory-safe programs by default
3. **Productivity**: Developers can build reliable software quickly
4. **Concurrency**: Natural to write concurrent programs
5. **Adoption**: Real projects choose Veyra for its benefits
